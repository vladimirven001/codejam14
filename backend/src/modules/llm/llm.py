Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.[4][5][6]  Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a given source node to every other node.[7]:196206 It can also be used to find the shortest path to a specific destination node, by terminating the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node is known. For example",

The algorithm uses a min-priority queue data structure for selecting the shortest paths known so far. Before more advanced priority queue structures were discovered, Dijkstra's original algorithm ran in  Î˜ ( | V | 2 ) {displaystyle Theta (|V|^{2})} time, where  | V | {displaystyle |V|} is the number of nodes.[8] The idea of this algorit"
